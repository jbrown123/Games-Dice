Revision history for Games-Die

0.999_02  2007-07-29
          total rewrite

0.05
          minor bug in adjust behavior
				  Push adjust value onto roll() return list only if adjust is non-zero,
				  instead of always pushing it as before (Ricardo)

0.04
          fixed minus-one bug, added +/- modfifiers

				  Fixed bug where a die would never roll its maximum value.  I
				  introduced this in 0.03 somehow and never caught it.  I thought I had
				  a grasp on basic arithmetic by now...

				  Added Ricardo Signes' +/-N adjustment to "d" style specifier (e.e.
				  2d8+1)

0.03
          fixed random number generation
				  Wrote Die::roll the right way so there is no longer a limit to the
				  number of sides (thanks to Thomas R. Sibley).  I am dumb.  :)

0.02
          added D&D dice specification, Dice::roll, documentation
          Increased die side limit from 100 to 10000 and documented the limit
          Added documentation for Games::Die::Dice
				  Games::Die::Dice now supports "D&D style" die descriptors in its
				  constructor (such as "2d8" or "6d20")
				  Games::Die::Dice::roll now returns the sum of the roll in scalar
				  context, as one would expect!

0.01
          initial release
